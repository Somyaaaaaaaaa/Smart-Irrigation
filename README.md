# Smart Irrigation System using AI

This project was developed as part of the **Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship in collaboration with AICTE**, aimed at building sustainable, AI-powered solutions. The goal is to automate irrigation decisions using sensor data and machine learning for optimal water usage in agriculture.

---

## Project Summary

An AI-powered Smart Irrigation System that predicts sprinkler activity (ON/OFF) for different farm parcels based on real-time environmental and soil sensor data. The system is trained using a MultiOutput Random Forest Classifier and deployed via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## Features

- **MultiParcel Prediction**: Classifies sprinkler status (ON/OFF) for 3 different land parcels.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Interactive sliders to input scaled sensor values and view predictions instantly.
- **Random Input Generator**: Auto-fill with random scaled values for quick simulations.
- **Clean Visualizations**: Step plots showcasing irrigation patterns over time.
- **Deployment Ready**: App built using Streamlit, model exported via `joblib`.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn` for model training  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data processing  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization  
  - `streamlit` for deployment  
  - `joblib` for model serialization
